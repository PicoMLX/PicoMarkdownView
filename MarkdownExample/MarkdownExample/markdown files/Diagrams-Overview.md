# Diagrams

Twelve examples from [Pele’s published gallery](https://pele.run/examples) demonstrate different diagram families, layouts and notation. Each graphic is followed by ordinary selectable Markdown. Open the full gallery for the complete set.

## Flowchart

An application architecture with grouped clients, services and storage. Solid and dotted arrows distinguish the paths between components.

```mermaid

config:
  theme: default
  look: classic
  layout: dagre
---
flowchart LR
  subgraph Client
    UI[Web app]
    Cache[(Local cache)]
  end
  subgraph Services
    API[API gateway]
    Auth[Auth service]
    Orders[Order service]
  end
  subgraph Storage
    DB[(Orders DB)]
  end
  UI --> API
  UI --> Cache
  API --> Auth
  API --> Orders
  Orders --> DB
  Auth -. token .-> UI
```

## Sequence

An order moves from customer to web app, API and bank. Numbered messages, an activation bar and a note show the stages of the exchange.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: default
  look: classic
---
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor Customer
  participant Web as Web app
  participant API as API gateway
  participant Bank
  Customer->>Web: Place order
  Web->>API: POST /orders
  activate API
  API->>Bank: Authorize payment
  Bank-->>API: Approved
  API-->>Web: 201 Created
  deactivate API
  Web-->>Customer: Order confirmed
  Note over Customer,Bank: One order, one transaction
```

## Class

Nested namespaces organise a volcanic system. Classes expose methods, and labelled relationships connect the parts.

```mermaid
---
config:
  class:
    hierarchicalNamespaces: false
---
classDiagram
    namespace Earth.Volcano.Summit {
        class Crater {
            +erupt()
        }
    }
    namespace Earth.Volcano.Slope {
        class LavaFlow {
            +buildLand()
        }
    }
    namespace Earth {
        class Hotspot {
            +meltRock()
        }
    }
    Hotspot --> Crater : feeds
    Hotspot --> LavaFlow : feeds
```

## Entity relationship

Cars, people and named drivers form a data model with primary, foreign and unique keys, typed fields and relationship cardinality.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    CAR {
        string registrationNumber PK
        string make
        string model
        string[] parts
    }
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
    PERSON {
        string driversLicense PK "The license #"
        string(99) firstName "Only 99 characters are allowed"
        string lastName
        string phone UK
        int age
    }
    NAMED-DRIVER {
        string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK
        string driverLicense PK, FK
    }
    MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes
```

## State

A document progresses from draft to publication. A nested review state and labelled transitions show approval and rejection paths.

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: default
  look: classic
  layout: dagre
---
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Draft
  Draft --> Submitted : submit
  state Review {
    [*] --> Screening
    Screening --> Decision
  }
  Submitted --> Review
  Review --> Published : approved
  Review --> Draft : rejected
  Published --> [*]
```

## Gantt

Task durations, calendar dates and a dependency appear on a shared timeline, grouped into project sections.

```mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    %% This is a comment
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Section
        A task          :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
        Another task    :after a1, 20d
    section Another
        Task in Another :2014-01-12, 12d
        another task    :24d
```

## Git graph

Branches diverge, merge and receive a cherry-picked commit. Explicit commit names make the resulting history easy to follow.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
        commit id: "ZERO"
        branch develop
        branch release
        commit id:"A"
        checkout main
        commit id:"ONE"
        checkout develop
        commit id:"B"
        checkout main
        merge develop id:"MERGE"
        commit id:"TWO"
        checkout release
        cherry-pick id:"MERGE" parent:"B"
        commit id:"THREE"
        checkout develop
        commit id:"C"
```

## Mindmap

A central topic branches into history, nature and culture. Nested labels demonstrate hierarchy, Unicode text and multiline content.

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Hawaiʻi))
    History
      Old legends
      ::icon(fa fa-book)
      Voyaging
        Polynesian navigators who sailed by the stars
    Nature
      Mountains<br/>and volcanoes
      Ocean life
        Reef
            Sea turtles
            Monk seals
            Parrotfish
    Culture
      Hula and lei
      ʻUkulele
```

## Timeline

Sectioned events and multiple labels describe the Hawaiian islands in a chronological layout.

```mermaid
timeline
    title Timeline of the Hawaiian Islands
    section Older islands
        Kauaʻi : 5 million years old, Canyons, Sea <br>cliffs
        Oʻahu : 3 million years old, Diamond Head, Surf breaks
        Molokaʻi : 2 million years old, Fishponds, Tall cliffs
    section Younger islands
        Maui : 1 million years old, Haleakalā, Whale watching
        Hawaiʻi : Still growing, Mauna Kea, Kīlauea
```

## User journey

A working day is split into phases. Each task includes a score and the people involved, adding an experience dimension to the sequence.

```mermaid
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

## Sankey

Flows from the electricity grid split into destinations. The width of each connection represents its numeric amount.

```mermaid
---
config:
  sankey:
    showValues: false
    nodeWidth: 15
    nodePadding: 20
---
sankey

Electricity grid,Heating and cooling - homes,113.726
Electricity grid,Industry,342.165
Electricity grid,Losses,56.691
```

## Radar

Four restaurant profiles share the same labelled axes and scale, making their relative strengths visible in one graphic.

```mermaid
radar-beta
  title Restaurant Comparison
  axis food["Food Quality"], service["Service"], price["Price"]
  axis ambiance["Ambiance"]

  curve a["Restaurant A"]{4, 3, 2, 4}
  curve b["Restaurant B"]{3, 4, 3, 3}
  curve c["Restaurant C"]{2, 3, 4, 2}
  curve d["Restaurant D"]{2, 2, 4, 3}

  graticule polygon
