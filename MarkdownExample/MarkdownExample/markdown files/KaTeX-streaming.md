Einstein’s most famous equation is **\(E = mc^{2}\)**.

It expresses the equivalence between energy (\(E\)) and mass (\(m\)), where \(c\) is the speed of light in a vacuum (\(\approx 3.00 \times 10^{8}\,\text{m/s}\)). In plain terms: a small amount of mass can be converted into a huge amount of energy, and vice versa. This principle underlies nuclear reactions and many modern technologies, from atomic power to particle physics experiments.

### How to use this cheat‑sheet

1. **Start with the “why”** – each equation captures a deep physical or mathematical insight.
2. **Explore derivations** – many of these formulas have surprisingly simple derivations (e.g., \(F=ma\) from Newton’s second law or the quadratic formula from completing the square).
3. **See the connections** – for instance, the Fourier transform underlies both signal processing and quantum mechanics.
4. **Apply them** – plug numbers into the formulas to solve real‑world problems (e.g., use \(E=mc^2\) to compute the energy released by a nuclear reaction).

Feel free to ask if you’d like a deeper dive into any particular equation, its history, derivation, or applications!

This doesn't work streaming:

Einstein’s most famous formula is

\[
\boxed{E = mc^{2}}
\]

It states that the energy (\(E\)) of a body is equal to its mass (\(m\)) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (\(c\)), illustrating that mass and energy are interchangeable. This simple yet profound equation became the cornerstone of modern physics and earned Einstein the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.
